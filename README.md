# Airbnb NYC EDA
This Capstone project is a part of my Data Science course at AlmaBetter.

Summary of this Project-

Airbnb is an online marketplace which connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in that locale. It currently covers more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries worldwide. For hosts, it is a way to earn money while protecting their property from potential damage. However, for guests, it is a risky venture that they should avoid.

For this project, we are analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City(NYC) data for 2019. NYC is not the only most famous city in the world but also a top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants and commerce. According to the Office of New York State Comptroller, NYC hosted 66.6 million visitors in 2019.

Data analysis on thousands of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. Our main objective is to find out the key metrics which are influencing the listing of properties on the platform. To fulfil this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We have found out that the distribution of every Airbnb listing is based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors. We have analyzed this dataset from different angles and came up with interesting insights. This will help in creating strategic data-driven decisions by the marketing team, finance team and technical team of Airbnb.
